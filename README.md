### WARNING:

Both versions send information 30 seconds after startup. 
This time is necessary for the server to start all the required services, 
including internet connection settings, before sending data. 
This approach ensures the system operates correctly and minimizes the 
likelihood of errors during automatic startup after being powered on.
